# Self Configuration

This recipe demonstrates the following:

- Starts an access point called `ESP_HOTSPOT`
- Starts an HTTP server on `80`
- Returns a form for self configuration

## Why?

Let's face it: configuring WiFi on an ESP is quite unnecessary.
Esprunio tooling already supports WiFi connect and remote
flashing. This recipe can be copied to embed firmware that allows
edge re-configuration for dynamic device gateways.
